# AJAX

This repository contains my testing of AJAX Using a basic calculation form.
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. AJAX

Created an HTML form with input fields for x1 and y1, a "Calculate Total" button, and a result div.

In the JavaScript code, when the button is clicked, it sends a GET request to process.php with the values of x1 and y1.

In process.php, it checks if x1 and y1 are set as GET parameters, calculates the total, and echoes it back.

The result from process.php is displayed in the result div.
